I would make the search more robust by adding a search bar that allows for more complex searches. I would also add a filter by specialty and years of experience.

I would make a new component for expandable cells so to be able to handle larger data sets and encorperate memoization in the AdvocatesTable component.

I would also add a loading state to the table so that the user knows that the data is loading.

I would add a separate specialties table to the schema so we can manage the specialties more easily and cleanly.
